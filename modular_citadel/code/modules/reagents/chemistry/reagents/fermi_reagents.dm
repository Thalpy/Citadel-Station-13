WHAT IT DOES

Several outcomes are possible (in priority order):

Before the chem is even created, there is a risk of the reaction "exploding", which produces an angry teratoma that attacks the player.
0. Before the chem is activated, the purity is checked, if the purity of the reagent is less than 0.5, then sythetic-derived zombie factor is metabolised instead
	0.1 If SDZF is injected, the chem appears to act the same as normal, with nutrition gain, until the end, where it becomes toxic instead, giving a short window of warning to the player
		0.1.2 If the player can take pent in time, the player will spawn a hostile teratoma on them (less damaging), if they don't, then a zombie is spawned instead, with a small defence increase propotional to the volume
	0.2 If the purity is above 0.5, then the remaining impure volume created SDGFtox instead, which reduces blood volume and causes clone damage
1.Normal function creates a (another)player controlled clone of the player, which is spawned nude, with damage to the clone
	1.1 The remaining volume is transferred to the clone, which heals it over time, thus the player has to make a substantial ammount of the chem in order to produce a healthy clone
	1.2 If the player is infected with a zombie tumor, the tumor is transferred to the ghost controlled clone ONLY.
2. If no player can be found, a brainless clone is created over a long period of time, this body has no controller.
	2.1 If the player dies with a clone, then they play as the clone instead. However no memories are retained after splitting.
3. If there is already a clone, then SDGF heals clone, fire and brute damage slowly. This shouldn't normalise this chem as the de facto clone healing chem, as it will always try to make a ghost clone, and then a brainless clone first.
4. If there is insuffient volume to complete the cloning process, there are two outcomes
	4.1 At lower volumes, the players nutrition and blood is refunded, with light healing
	4.2 At higher volumes a stronger heal is applied to the user

IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHILE BALANCING
1. The most important factor is the required volume, this is easily edited with the metabolism rate, this chem is HARD TO MAKE, You need to make a lot of it and it's a substantial effort on the players part. There is also a substantial risk; you could spawn a hotile teratoma during the reation, you could damage yourself with clone damage, you could accidentally spawn a zombie... Basically, you've a good chance of killing yourself.
	1.1 Additionally, if you're trying to make SDZF purposely, you've no idea if you have or not, and that reaction is even harder to do. Plus, the player has a huge time window to get to medical to deal with it. If you take pent while it's in you, it'll be removed before it can spawn, and only spawns a teratoma if it's late stage.
2. The rate in which the clone is made, This thing takes time to produce fruits, it slows you down and makes you useless in combat/working. Basically you can't do anything during it. It will only get you killed if you use it in combat, If you do use it and you spawn a player clone, they're gimped for a long time, as they have to heal off the clone damage.
3. The healing - it's pretty low and a cyropod is more Useful
4. If you're an antag, you've a 50% chance of making a clone that will help you with your efforts, and you've no idea if they will or not. While clones can't directly harm you and care for you, they can hinder your efforts.
5. If people are being arses when they're a clone, slap them for it, they are told to NOT bugger around with someone else character, if it gets bad I'll add a blacklist, or do a check to see if you've played X amount of hours.
	5.1 Another solution I'm okay with is to rename the clone to [M]'s clone, so it's obvious, this obviously ruins anyone trying to clone themselves to get an alibi however. I'd prefer this to not be the case.
	5.2 Additionally, this chem is a soft buff to changelings, which apparently need a buff!
	5.3 Other similar things exist already though in the codebase; impostors, split personalites, abductors, ect.
6. Giving this to someone without concent is against space law and gets you sent to gulag.

More fun chems!
When you take it, it spawns a ghost that the player controls. (No access to deadchat)
This ghost moves pretty quickly and is mostly invisible, but is still visible for people with eyes.
When it's out of your system, you return back to yourself. It doesn't last long and metabolism of the chem is exponential.
Addiction is particularlly brutal, it slowly turns you invisible with flavour text, then kills you at a low enough alpha. (i've also added something to prevent geneticists speeding this up)
There's afairly major catch regarding the death though. I'm not gonna say here, go read the code, it explains it and puts my comments on it in context. I know that anyone reading it without understanding it is going to freak out so, this is my attempt to get you to read it and understand it.
I'd like to point out from my calculations it'll take about 60-80 minutes to die this way too. Plenty of time to visit me and ask for some pills to quench your addiction.

The magnum opus of FermiChem -
Long and complicated, I highly recomend you look at the two other files heavily involved in this
modular_citadel/code/datums/status_effects/chems.dm - handles the subject's reactions
code/modules/surgery/organs/vocal_cords.dm - handles the enchanter speaking

HOW IT WORKS
Fermis_Reagent.dm
There's 3 main ways this chemical works; I'll start off with discussing how it's set up.
Upon reacting with blood as a catalyst, the blood is used to define who the enthraller is - thus only the creator is/can choose who the master will be. As a side note, you can't adminbus this chem, even admins have to earn it.
This uses the fermichem only proc; FermiCreate, which is basically the same as On_new, except it doesn't require "data" which is something to do with blood and breaks everything so I said bugger it and made my own proc. It basically sets up vars.
When it's first made, the creator has to drink some of it, in order to give them the vocal chords needed.
When it's given to someone, it gives them the status effect and kicks off that side of things. For every metabolism tick, it increases the enthrall tally.
Finally, if you manage to pump 100u into some poor soul, you overload them, and mindbreak them. Making them your willing, but broken slave. Which can only be reversed by; fixing their brain with mannitol and neurine (100 / 50u respectively) (or less with both),

vocal_cords.dm
This handles when the enchanter speaks - basically uses code from voice of god, but only for people with the staus effect. Most of the words are self explainitory, and has a smaller range of commands. If you're not sure what one does, it likely affects the enthrall tally, or the resist tally.

Mixables can be used intersperced with other commands, 0 is commands that work on sleeper against (i.e. players enthralled to state 3, then ordered to wake up and forget, they can be triggered back instantly)
1 is for players who immediately are injected with the chem - no stuns, only a silence and something that draws them towrds them. This is the best time to try to fight it and you're likely to win by spamming resist, unless the enchantress has plans.
2 is the seconds stage, which allows removal of clothes, slowdown and light stunning. You can also make them nya and awoo, because cute.
3 is the finaly state, which allows application of a few status effects (see chem.dm) and allows custom triggers to be installed (kind of like nanites), again, see chem.dm
In a nutshell, this is the way you enthrall people, by typing messages into chat and managing cooldowns on the stronger words. You have to type words and your message strength is increases with the number of characters - if you type short messages the cooldown will be too much and the other player will overcome the chem.
I suppose people could spam gdjshogndjoadphgiuaodp but, the truth of this chem is that it mostly allows a casus beli for subs to give in, and everyones a sub on cit (mostly), so if you aujigbnadjgipagdsjk then they might resist harder cause you're a baddie and baddies don't deserve pets.
Also, the use of this chem as a murder aid is antithetic to it's design, the subject gains bonus resistance if they're hurt or hungry (I'd like to expland this more, I like the idea that you have to look after all of them otherwise they aren't as effective, kind of like tamagachis!). If this becomes a problem, I'll deal with it, I'm not happy with people abusing this chem for an easy murder. (I might make it so you an't strike your pet when health is too low.)
Additionaly, in lieu of previous statement - the pet is ordered to not kill themselves, even if ordered to.

chem.dm
oof
There's a few basic things that have to be understood with this status effect
1. There is a min loop which calculates the enthrall state of the subject, when the entrall tally is over a certain amount, it will push you up 1 phase.
0 - Sleeper
1 - initial
2 - enthralled
3 - Fully entranced
4 - mindbroken
4 can only be reached via OD, whereas you can increment up from 1 > 2 > 3. 0 is only obtainable on a state 3 pet, and it toggles between the two.

1.5 Chem warfare
Since this is a chem, it's expected that you will use all of the chemicals at your disposal. Using aphro and aphro+ will weaken the resistance of the subject, while ananphro, anaphro+, mannitol and neurine will strengthen it.
Additionally, the more aroused you are, the weaker your resistance will be, as a result players immune to aphro and anaphro give a flat bonus to the enthraller.
using furranium and hatmium on the enchanter weakens their power considerably, because they sound rediculous. "Youwe fweewing wery sweepy uwu" This completely justifies their existance.
The impure toxin for this chem increases resistance too, so if they're a bad chemist it'll be unlikely they have a good ratio (and as a secret bonus, really good chemists cann purposely make the impure chem, to use either to combat the use of it against them, or as smoke grenades to deal with a large party)

2. There is a resistance proc which occurs whenever the player presses resist. You have to press it a lot, this is intentional. If you're trying to fight the enchanter, then you can't click both. You usually will win if you just mash resist and the enchanter does nothing, so you've got to react.
Each step futher it becomes harder to resist, in state 2 it's longer, but resisting is still worthwhile. If you're not in state 3, and you've not got MKultra inside of you, you generate resistance very fast. So in some cases the better option will be to stall out any attempts to entrance you.
At the moment, resistance doesn't affect the commands - mostly because it's a way to tell if a state 3 is trying to resist. But this might change if it gets too hard to fight them off.
Durign state 3, it's impossible to resist if the enthraller is in your presence (8 tiles), you generate no resistance if so. If they're out of your range, then you start to go into the addiction processed
As your resistance is tied to your arousal, sometimes your best option is to wah

3. The addition process starts when the enthraller is out of range, it roughtly follows the five stages of grief; denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.
What it mostly does makes you sad, hurts your brain, and sometimes you lash out in anger.
Denial - minor brain damaged
bargaining - 50:50 chance of brain damage and brain healing
anger - randomly lashing out and hitting people
depression - massive mood loss, stuttering, jittering, hallucinations and brain damage
depression, again - random stunning and crying, brain damage, and resistance
acceptance - minor brain damage and resistance.
You can also resist while out of range, but you can only break free of a stange 3 enthrallment by hitting the acceptance phase with a high enough resistance.
Finally, being near your enthraller reverts the damages caused.
It is expected that if you intend to break free you'll need to use psicodine and mannitol or you'll end up in a bad, but not dead, state. This gives more work for medical!! Finally the true rational of this complicated chem comes out.

4. Status effects in status effects.
There's a few commands that give status effects, such as antiresist, which will cause resistance presses to increase the enthrallment instead, theses are called from the vocal chords.
They're mostly self explainitory; antiresist, charge, pacify and heal. Heals quite weak for obvious reasons. I'd like to add more, maybe some weak adneals with brute/exhaustion costs after the status is over. A truth serum might be neat too.
State 4 pets don't get status effects.

5. Custom triggers
Because it wasnt complicated enough already.
Custom triggers are set by stating a trigger word, which will call a sub proc, which is also defined when the trigger is Called
The effects avalible at the moment are:
Speak - forces pet to say a preallocated phrase in response to the trigger
Echo - sends a message to that player only (i.e. makes them think something)
Shock - gives them a seizure/zaps them
You can look this one up yourself - it's what you expect, it's cit
kneel - gives a short knockdown
strip - strips jumpsuit only
objective - gives the pet a new objective. This requires a high ammount of mental capasity - which is determined by how much you resist. If you resist enough during phase 1 and 2, then they can't give you an objective.
Feel free to add more.
triggers work when said by ANYONE, not just the enchanter.
This is only state 3 pets, state 4 pets cannot get custom triggers, you broke them you bully.

7. If you're an antage you get a bonus to resistance AND to enthralling. Thus it can be worth using this on both sides. It shouldn't be hard to resist as an antag. There are futher bonuses to command, Chaplains and chemist.
If you give your pet a collar then their resistance reduced too.
(I think thats everything?)

Failstates:
Blowing up the reaction produces a gas that causes everyone to fall in love with one another.

Creating a chem with a low purity will make you permanently fall in love with someone, and tasked with keeping them safe. If someone else drinks it, you fall for them.
