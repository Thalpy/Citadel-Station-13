Liver - needs alcohol - purges everything else, heals with strength of alcohol
Brain - mindshield?
stomach - require alcohol to not suffer mood penalties, but comes with buffs in the form of decreased stam buffer regen costs depending on how many people you're able to see. this would be in-line with dorf fortress' dwarves, and the latter effect would effectively simulate the dwarven battle trance
